## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Not a valid XP3 file" Error
- **Cause**: File is corrupted or not actually an XP3 archive
- **Solution**: Verify file integrity, try with different XP3 file

#### "Python is not installed" Error
- **Cause**: Python not installed or not in system PATH
- **Solution**: Install Python from [python.org](https://python.org) and ensure "Add to PATH" is checked

#### Application Won't Start
- **Cause**: Missing dependencies
- **Solution**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Images Not Displaying
- **Cause**: Pillow/PIL installation issues
- **Solution**: Reinstall Pillow: `pip uninstall Pillow && pip install Pillow`

#### Slow Performance
- **Cause**: Large archives or low system resources
- **Solution**: Close other applications, upgrade RAM, or use SSD storage

### Debug Mode

To enable debug output, modify the application:

1. Edit `xp3_viewer_converter.py`
2. Change debug flag to `True` at the top of the file
3. Run application from command line to see debug output
